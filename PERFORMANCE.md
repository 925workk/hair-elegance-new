# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to address the Lighthouse performance issues.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Render Blocking Requests
- **Problem**: CSS files were blocking the initial render
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `display: 'swap'` to font loading
  - Preloaded critical images
  - Added DNS prefetch and preconnect for external resources
  - Optimized CSS with critical styles

### 2. LCP Request Discovery
- **Problem**: LCP image needed `fetchpriority="high"`
- **Solution**:
  - Added `fetchPriority="high"` to the hero image
  - Added proper `sizes` attributes to all images
  - Preloaded critical images in the head

### 3. Network Dependency Tree
- **Problem**: Critical path latency was 278ms
- **Solution**:
  - Enabled image optimization in Next.js config
  - Added WebP and AVIF format support
  - Implemented proper caching headers
  - Added service worker for caching

## Optimizations Implemented

### Image Optimization
- Enabled Next.js image optimization
- Added WebP and AVIF format support
- Added proper `sizes` attributes for responsive images
- Preloaded critical images
- Added `fetchPriority="high"` to LCP image

### Font Optimization
- Added `display: 'swap'` to Google Fonts
- Preloaded critical fonts
- Added font-display CSS properties

### CSS Optimization
- Added critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Optimized animations and transitions
- Added performance-focused utility classes

### Caching Strategy
- Added service worker for static asset caching
- Implemented proper cache headers
- Added long-term caching for images and static assets

### Performance Monitoring
- Added Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Implemented Intersection Observer for lazy loading
- Added performance tracking components

## Build Optimizations

### Next.js Configuration
- Enabled image optimization
- Added compression
- Removed console logs in production
- Added security headers
- Enabled CSS optimization

### Bundle Optimization
- Removed unused dependencies
- Optimized component imports
- Added tree shaking support

## Usage

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Image Optimization
```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze
```

## Expected Performance Improvements

- **LCP**: Reduced from 278ms to under 2.5s
- **FID**: Improved to under 100ms
- **CLS**: Reduced to under 0.1
- **Overall Score**: Improved to 90+ on Lighthouse

## Monitoring

The application includes built-in performance monitoring that tracks:
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

Performance metrics are logged to the console and can be integrated with analytics services.

## Best Practices

1. **Images**: Always use Next.js Image component with proper sizing
2. **Fonts**: Use `display: 'swap'` for all web fonts
3. **CSS**: Keep critical styles inline, defer non-critical CSS
4. **JavaScript**: Use dynamic imports for non-critical components
5. **Caching**: Leverage service worker and proper cache headers
6. **Monitoring**: Track Core Web Vitals continuously
