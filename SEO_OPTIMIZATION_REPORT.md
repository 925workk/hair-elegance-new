### 1. H1 Tag Font-Size Warning ✅

  .hero-title {
    font-size: 3.75rem !important;
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Updated Next.js configuration and CSS loading strategy

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added proper Content-Type header in next.config.ts
- Replaced deferred CSS loading with preload strategy
- Added noscript fallback for CSS loading

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// next.config.ts
{
  source: '/globals.css',
  headers: [
    {
      key: 'Content-Type',
      value: 'text/css; charset=utf-8',
